## Introduction:
--- about structural design patterns

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy
   
## Task:

1. By extending your project (Lab#1*), implement at least 3 structural design patterns:

* The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
* The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
* There should only be one client for the whole system;

2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities;

3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the required structure.
