## Introduction:
--- about structural design patterns

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy
   
## Task:

1. By extending your project (Lab#1*), implement at least 3 structural design patterns in your project:

The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
There should only be one client for the whole system;

2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):

client;
domain;
utilities;
data(if applies);

3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):

Topic of the laboratory work;
Author;
Introduction/Theory/Motivation;
Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well):
Indicate the location of the code snippet;
Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern;
Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;

*Lab#1 -
