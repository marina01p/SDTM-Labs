## Introduction:

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures. Its design pattern simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships and focus on how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Adapter
   * Bridge
   * Composite
   * Decorator
   * Facade
   * Flyweight
   * Proxy
   
## Task:

1. By extending your project (Lab#1*), implement at least 3 structural design patterns:

    * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
    * The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
    * There should only be one client for the whole system;

    *[Lab#1](https://github.com/marina01p/SDTM-Labs/tree/main/Lab%231)
  
2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities;

3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the required structure.


## Implementation & Explanation:

The project is written in Java JDK 15.

Implemented structural design pattern used in this laboratory work are:
