## Task:

1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed);
2. Select a domain area for the sample project;
3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed;
4. Based on the previous point, implement atleast 3 creational design patterns in your project;

## Some Theory:
In software engineering, creational design patterns are a way of structuring code to make it more simple, maintainable and effective.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

   * Singleton
   * Builder
   * Prototype
   * Object Pooling
   * Factory Method
   * Abstract Factory
   
## Implementation & Explanation:

The project is written in Java JDK 15.

Implemented creational design pattern used in this laboratory work are:
  1. Builder
  2. Singleton
  3. Factory Method
  4. Abstract Factory

### Builder
