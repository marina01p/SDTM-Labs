## Introduction

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns have the purpose of identifying common communication patterns between different software entities. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Interpreter
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Observer
* Strategy
   
## Objectives

1. By extending your project, implement as many behavioral design patterns as you need in your project:

    * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system;
    * The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client;
    * The behavioral DPs can be integrated into you functionalities alongside the structural ones;
    * There should only be one client for the whole system;

2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities.

3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):


## Implementation

### Tools

* Intellij IDEA
* Java SE 15

Implemented structural design pattern, for this laboratory work, are:
